##Tumblr to Markdown converter

This app converts your Tumblr posts to Markdown, formatted for use with [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am)

This is a work in progress, right now you have to copy paste the text to use the web app, but the core converter has the ability to write to file

Run bundle;
Set your environment variables tumblr_key, and tumblr_secret;
and then just shotgun, there are no databases in use here!

I use [html2markdown](https://github.com/29decibel/html2markdown) and the official [Tumblr client](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr_client)
